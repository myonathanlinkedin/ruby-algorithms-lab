# Two-Phase Commit Protocol Coordinator and Participant State Machine

Core **Ruby** implementation for **Two-Phase Commit Protocol Coordinator and Participant State Machine**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `Ruby` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Distributed Consensus & State Machine` using `Append-Only State Log & Version Matrix`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(N) during sync` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N) state log` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.rb` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Two-Phase Commit Protocol Coordinator and Participant State Machine` in `Ruby`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
