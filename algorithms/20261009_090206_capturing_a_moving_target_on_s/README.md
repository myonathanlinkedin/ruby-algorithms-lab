# Capturing a Moving Target on Star Graphs by Two Communicating Mobile Agents

A clean, dependency-free **Ruby** reference implementation of **Capturing a Moving Target on Star Graphs by Two Communicating Mobile Agents**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `Ruby` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Graph Topology & Traversal` using `Adjacency List & Priority Heap`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(V + E)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(V^2)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(V + E)` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.rb` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Capturing a Moving Target on Star Graphs by Two Communicating Mobile Agents` in `Ruby`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
